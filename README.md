# Order-Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries and analysis conducted as part of a guided project based on ["Advanced SQL Retrieval Queries in SQLiteStudio" by Judy Richardson](https://www.coursera.org/projects/advanced-sql-retrieval-queries-in-sqlitestudio), along with additional SQL code authored by me.

## Overview

This project includes a series of SQL queries designed to analyze order data. The queries address various questions related to order management, product sales, customer behavior, and financial performance.

### Features

- Extraction of essential insights from order data.
- Identification of patterns and trends in product sales.
- Analysis of customer behavior and discount utilization.

## Queries

The SQL queries in this project are categorized into two sections:

1. **Guided Project Queries**: SQL queries extracted from the guided project. These queries cover essential aspects of order analysis, such as average order price, shipping details, product counts, and discounts.

2. **Custom Queries**: Additional SQL queries created for further analysis. These queries delve deeper into specific aspects, such as identifying products with the highest sales volume, determining the most popular fabric color among customers, and analyzing customers' utilization of discount levels.

### Example Queries

Here are examples of some queries included in this project:

- **Average Order Price and Multiple Items Identification**
- **Most Active Shipping Company**
- **Products with the Highest Sales Volume**
- **Customers with the Highest Discount Utilization**

## How to Use

To run these SQL queries, you'll need access to a database management system compatible with SQLite. Simply copy and paste the queries into your SQL editor and execute them against your database containing order data.
